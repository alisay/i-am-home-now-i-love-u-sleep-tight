### Weird stuff

> - You might have to `chmod` a bunch of shit

## Configuration

There are several options to configure inside `i-am-home-now-i-love-u-sleep-tight.sh` ‚§µ

```shell
home="City"
# your home. check by running `$ curl https://ipinfo.io/city -s` when ur at home


n=23
# what hour (24h) you want this script to run (11pm here)
m=4
# what hour (24h) you want this script to stop running (4am here)

# ‚Üë your message sends if the time right now is >= $n, or > $m
# In this example this means that if you wake your computer between 11pm-4am after hanging out w them, this script will automatically send them a message letting them know you are home


b="Your Best Friend"
# the name of your best friend (they need to be in your contacts)
# idk if this is first names, first name + last name, nickname or what. my best friend is saved as an emoji so at least u know that works too

message="i am home now i love u sleep tight"
# message to send ur best friend to let them know you are home safe and sound and that u love them ‚Äî triggers if time right now is >= $n, or > $m

thinkin="thinking about u :)"
# message to send your best friend to let them know you are thinking about them ‚Äî has a 1/20 chance of triggering when your computer wakes _outside_ of your $n & $m hours.
```

## Uninstall

```shell
$ unlink /path/to/i-am-home-now-i-love-u-sleep-tight.plist
$ unlink ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.oschrenk.sleepwatcher.plist # just to be safe
$ launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.oschrenk.sleepwatcher.plist
$ brew uninstall sleepwatchers
```

restart and then do a fresh OS install just to be safe

## Notes

- macOS only - sorry :(
- You can disable the randomized "thinking about u" messages by removing the `elif` statement in `_i-am-home-now-i-love-u-sleep-tight.sh`
- This uses iMessage. I'm sure you could get it working p easily w Twilio or something if you wanted to
- Don't use this as a substitute for being safe. When your friends ask you to text them when you get home safe, they really just want to know that you're safe. This app doesn't prove you're safe it just proves that you can install and run LaunchDaemons

- text ur friends lol. they love u
